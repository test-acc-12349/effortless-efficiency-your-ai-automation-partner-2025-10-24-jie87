## Getting Started

### What You Need to Know

This landing page uses three main technologies:

1. **HTML** - The structure and content of the page (the "skeleton")
2. **Tailwind CSS** - A utility-based styling system that handles colors, spacing, and layout
3. **Font Awesome** - An icon library that provides the small graphics throughout the page

### How to Edit This File

1. Open `index.html` in a text editor (we recommend VS Code, Sublime Text, or even Notepad++)
2. Make your changes to the HTML code
3. Save the file (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
4. Open the file in your web browser to see the changes
5. Refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R) to see updates

### Important: Don't Break the Code

When editing HTML, remember:
- Every opening tag `<div>` needs a closing tag `</div>`
- Don't delete quotes around attributes
- Keep the indentation (spacing) consistent for readability
- If something breaks, look for mismatched tags or missing quotes

## Understanding the Page Structure

### Main Sections of Your Landing Page

Your landing page is organized into distinct sections, each with a specific `id` attribute for navigation:

```
├── Header & Navigation (sticky at top)
├── Hero Section (main title and CTA)
├── Features Section (id="features")
├── Benefits Section (id="benefits")
├── CTA Section (call-to-action)
├── Testimonials Section (id="testimonials")
├── About Us Section (id="about")
├── FAQ Section (id="faq")
├── Final CTA Section
├── Footer
└── JavaScript (interactive features)
```

### Why Section IDs Matter

The `id` attribute allows you to:
- Create navigation links that jump to specific sections
- Reference sections in your code
- Track which section is which

For example, `<section id="features">` can be linked to with `<a href="#features">Features</a>`

---

## Updating Text Content

### 1. Changing the Page Title

**Location:** Line 7 in the `<head>` section

**Current code:**
```html
<title>Effortless Efficiency: Your AI Automation Partner</title>
```

**How to change it:**
1. Find this line near the top of the file
2. Replace the text between `<title>` and `</title>` with your own title
3. This title appears in browser tabs and search results

**Example:**
```html
<title>Your Company Name - AI Solutions</title>
```

---

### 2. Updating the Meta Description

**Location:** Line 8 in the `<head>` section

**Current code:**
```html
<meta name="description" content="Effortless Efficiency: Your AI Automation Partner. Reclaim your time and boost productivity through seamless AI solutions.">
```

**How to change it:**
1. Find this line
2. Replace the text in `content="..."` with your description
3. Keep it under 160 characters for search engines
4. This appears below your title in Google search results

**Example:**
```html
<meta name="description" content="Transform your business with our AI automation platform. Save time, reduce costs, and boost productivity.">
```

---

### 3. Updating the Hero Section (Main Headline)

**Location:** Lines 107-112

**Current code:**
```html
<h1 class="text-4xl sm:text-5xl lg:text-7xl font-bold mb-6 leading-tight tracking-tight">
    <span class="block mb-2">Effortless Efficiency:</span>
    <span class="gradient-text">Your AI Automation Partner</span>
</h1>
```

**How to change it:**

The headline is split into two parts:
- First line: `<span class="block mb-2">Effortless Efficiency:</span>`
- Second line (with purple gradient): `<span class="gradient-text">Your AI Automation Partner</span>`

To change the headline:
1. Replace `Effortless Efficiency:` with your first line
2. Replace `Your AI Automation Partner` with your second line
3. The `gradient-text` class makes the second line purple—keep this class if you want the same effect

**Example:**
```html
<h1 class="text-4xl sm:text-5xl lg:text-7xl font-bold mb-6 leading-tight tracking-tight">
    <span class="block mb-2">Transform Your Business:</span>
    <span class="gradient-text">With Intelligent Automation</span>
</h1>
```

---

### 4. Updating the Hero Subtitle

**Location:** Lines 114-117

**Current code:**
```html
<p class="text-xl sm:text-2xl text-gray-300 mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
    Reclaim your time and boost productivity through seamless AI. Transform your workflows, eliminate manual tasks, and focus on what truly matters for your business growth.
</p>
```

**How to change it:**
1. Find this paragraph text
2. Replace it with your own description
3. Keep the HTML tags the same—only change the text between `<p>` and `</p>`

---

### 5. Updating Feature Cards

**Location:** Lines 155-223 (three feature cards)

**Current code example (Feature 1):**
```html
<div class="feature-card bg-gray-800 border border-gray-700 p-8 rounded-xl">
    <div class="w-16 h-16 gradient-accent rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center mb-6">
        <i class="fas fa-cogs text-white text-2xl"></i>
    </div>
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Workflow Automation</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-400 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Automate repetitive tasks and complex workflows...
    </p>
    <div class="space-y-3">
        <div class="flex items-start gap-3">
            <i class="fas fa-check text-purple-500 mt-1"></i>
            <span class="text-gray-300">Intelligent task scheduling</span>
        </div>
        <!-- More bullet points -->
    </div>
</div>
```

**How to change it:**

1. **Change the title:** Replace `Workflow Automation` with your feature name
2. **Change the description:** Replace the paragraph text
3. **Change the icon:** Replace `fa-cogs` with another Font Awesome icon (see [Font Awesome Icons](#font-awesome-icons-reference) below)
4. **Change bullet points:** Replace the text in each `<span class="text-gray-300">` tag

**Example:**
```html
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Smart Data Processing</h3>
<p class="text-gray-400 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
    Process large datasets instantly with AI-powered analysis and insights.
</p>
```

---

### 6. Updating Testimonials

**Location:** Lines 356-410 (testimonial cards)

**Current code example:**
```html
<div class="testimonial-card bg-gray-900 border border-gray-700 p-8 rounded-xl">
    <div class="flex items-center gap-1 mb-4">
        <i class="fas fa-star text-yellow-400"></i>
        <i class="fas fa-star text-yellow-400"></i>
        <i class="fas fa-star text-yellow-400"></i>
        <i class="fas fa-star text-yellow-400"></i>
        <i class="fas fa-star text-yellow-400"></i>
    </div>
    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
        "This AI automation platform has been a game-changer..."
    </p>
    <div class="border-t border-gray-700 pt-4">
        <p class="font-bold text-white">Sarah Mitchell</p>
        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">Director of Operations, Tech Solutions Inc.</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

**How to change it:**

1. **Change the testimonial text:** Replace the quoted text in the `<p class="text-gray-300 mb-6...">` tag
2. **Change the customer name:** Replace `Sarah Mitchell`
3. **Change the customer title/company:** Replace `Director of Operations, Tech Solutions Inc.`
4. **Adjust star rating:** Remove or add `<i class="fas fa-star text-yellow-400"></i>` lines to change from 5 stars to another rating

**Example:**
```html
<p class="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
    "Incredible results in just two weeks! Our team saved 30 hours per week."
</p>
<div class="border-t border-gray-700 pt-4">
    <p class="font-bold text-white">John Anderson</p>
    <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">CEO, Innovation Labs</p>
</div>
```

---

### 7. Updating the FAQ Section

**Location:** Lines 472-540

**Current code example (one FAQ item):**
```html
<div class="faq-item bg-gray-900 border border-gray-700 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
    <button class="faq-question w-full p-6 flex items-center justify-between hover:bg-gray-800 transition-colors duration-300 cursor-pointer">
        <span class="text-lg font-semibold text-white text-left">How long does it take to implement the platform?</span>
        <i class="faq-icon fas fa-chevron-down text-purple-500 transition-transform duration-300"></i>
    </button>
    <div class="faq-answer hidden px-6 pb-6">
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Most implementations take between 2-4 weeks...
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
```

**How to change it:**

1. **Change the question:** Replace `How long does it take to implement the platform?`
2. **Change the answer:** Replace the text in the `<p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">` tag
3. **Add new FAQ items:** Copy the entire `<div class="faq-item">` block and paste it, then update the question and answer

**Example of updating one FAQ:**
```html
<button class="faq-question w-full p-6 flex items-center justify-between hover:bg-gray-800 transition-colors duration-300 cursor-pointer">
    <span class="text-lg font-semibold text-white text-left">What is your refund policy?</span>
    <i class="faq-icon fas fa-chevron-down text-purple-500 transition-transform duration-300"></i>
</button>
<div class="faq-answer hidden px-6 pb-6">
    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee with no questions asked.
    </p>
</div>
```

---

### 8. Updating the About Section

**Location:** Lines 420-467

**Current code:**
```html
<p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
    Founded in 2019 by a team of AI researchers and business automation experts...
</p>
```

**How to change it:**

2. Replace it with your company's story
3. You can add multiple paragraphs by using multiple `<p>` tags

---

<span class="text-lg font-bold text-white">AI Automation</span>
```

## Modifying Colors and Styling

### Understanding Tailwind CSS Classes

Tailwind CSS uses utility classes that control styling. Here are the most common ones on this page:

| Class | What It Does | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `bg-gray-900` | Background color | `bg-purple-600`, `bg-pink-500` |
| `text-white` | Text color | `text-gray-300`, `text-purple-500` |
| `text-4xl` | Font size | `text-lg`, `text-5xl`, `text-7xl` |
| `font-bold` | Font weight | `font-semibold`, `font-normal` |
| `px-8` | Horizontal padding | `px-4`, `px-6`, `px-10` |
| `py-4` | Vertical padding | `py-2`, `py-6`, `py-24` |
| `rounded-lg` | Border radius | `rounded-xl`, `rounded-2xl` |
| `border-gray-700` | Border color | `border-purple-500`, `border-white` |

### Changing the Main Color Scheme

The page uses a **purple-to-pink gradient** throughout. To change this:

**Current gradient:**
```html
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
```

This is defined in the `<style>` section (lines 17-22). To change it:

1. Find the `.gradient-text` and `.gradient-accent` classes in the `<style>` section
2. Replace `#667eea` and `#764ba2` with your desired colors
3. Use hex color codes (find them at [colorhexa.com](https://www.colorhexa.com))

**Example - changing to blue-green:**
```css
.gradient-text {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #0066ff 0%, #00cc99 100%);
    -webkit-background-clip: text;
    -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
    background-clip: text;
}
```

### Changing Button Colors

**Primary button (purple gradient):**
```html
<a href="https://test.com" class="btn-primary bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-pink-600 px-8 py-4 rounded-lg">
```

To change the button color, replace:
- `from-purple-600` - the starting color
- `to-pink-600` - the ending color

**Example - changing to blue:**
```html
class="btn-primary bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-blue-400 px-8 py-4 rounded-lg"
```

### Changing Text Colors

Find text color classes like `text-gray-300` and replace them:

| Current | Lighter | Darker |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `text-gray-300` | `text-gray-200` | `text-gray-400` |
| `text-white` | (already lightest) | `text-gray-100` |
| `text-purple-500` | `text-purple-400` | `text-purple-600` |

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Change from gray to blue -->
<p class="text-gray-300">Original text</p>
<p class="text-blue-300">Updated text</p>
```

### Changing Background Colors

**Page background:**
```html
<body class="bg-gray-900 text-white">
```

To change, replace `bg-gray-900` with another color like `bg-slate-900` or `bg-gray-800`

**Section backgrounds:**
```html
<section class="py-24 bg-gray-800 bg-opacity-50">
```

To change: replace `bg-gray-800` with your color

## Fixing and Updating Links

### Understanding Links in HTML

A link in HTML looks like this:
```html
<a href="https://example.com">Click Here</a>
```

- `<a>` = the link tag
- `href="..."` = where the link goes
- The text between `<a>` and `</a>` = what users see and click

### Types of Links on This Page

1. **External links** - go to other websites (start with `https://`)
2. **Internal links** - jump to sections on the same page (start with `#`)
3. **Placeholder links** - currently point to `https://test.com` (need updating)

---

### Finding All Links That Need Updating

The page currently has many placeholder links pointing to `https://test.com`. Here's where they are:

#### In the Navigation Menu (Lines 33-37):
```html
<a href="https://test.com" class="btn-primary...">Get Started</a>
```

#### In the Hero Section (Lines 120-125):
```html
<a href="https://test.com" class="btn-primary...">
    <i class="fas fa-rocket mr-2"></i>
    Start Your Journey
</a>
```

#### In the Mobile Menu (Lines 55-56):
```html
<a href="https://test.com" class="btn-primary...">Get Started</a>
```

#### In the CTA Section (Line 282):
```html
<a href="https://test.com" class="btn-primary...">
    <i class="fas fa-star mr-2"></i>
    Start Free Trial Now
</a>
```

#### In the Final CTA Section (Lines 555-560):
```html
<a href="https://test.com" class="btn-primary...">Start Free Trial</a>
```

#### In the Footer (Lines 607-609):
```html
<li><a href="https://test.com" class="text-gray-400...">Pricing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://test.com" class="text-gray-400...">Careers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://test.com" class="text-gray-400...">Contact</a></li>
```

---

### Step-by-Step: Updating All Links

**Step 1: Identify all `https://test.com` links**

Use your text editor's Find & Replace feature:
1. Press `Ctrl+H` (Windows) or `Cmd+H` (Mac)
2. In "Find" field, type: `https://test.com`
3. In "Replace" field, type: your actual URL (e.g., `https://yourcompany.com/signup`)

**Step 2: Replace them all at once**

Click "Replace All" to update every instance at once. This is much faster than doing it one by one.

**Step 3: Update specific links**

Some links should go to different places:

| Link Text | Current | Should Go To |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| "Get Started" | `https://test.com` | Your signup page |
| "Watch Demo" | (no link) | Your demo video or page |
| "Pricing" | `https://test.com` | Your pricing page |
| "Careers" | `https://test.com` | Your careers page |
| "Contact" | `https://test.com` | Your contact page |

---

### Example: Updating the Hero "Get Started" Button

**Current code (Line 120-125):**
```html
<a href="https://test.com" class="btn-primary bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-pink-600 px-8 py-4 rounded-lg font-bold text-lg hover:shadow-2xl transition-all duration-300 inline-flex items-center justify-center">
    <i class="fas fa-rocket mr-2"></i>
    Start Your Journey
</a>
```

**Updated code:**
```html
<a href="https://yourcompany.com/get-started" class="btn-primary bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-pink-600 px-8 py-4 rounded-lg font-bold text-lg hover:shadow-2xl transition-all duration-300 inline-flex items-center justify-center">
    <i class="fas fa-rocket mr-2"></i>
    Start Your Journey
</a>
```

All you changed was: `href="https://test.com"` → `href="https://yourcompany.com/get-started"`

---

### Adding Internal Navigation Links

These links jump to sections on the same page. They're already set up correctly:

```html
<a href="#features">Features</a>  <!-- Jumps to id="features" -->
<a href="#benefits">Benefits</a>  <!-- Jumps to id="benefits" -->
<a href="#testimonials">Testimonials</a>  <!-- Jumps to id="testimonials" -->
<a href="#faq">FAQ</a>  <!-- Jumps to id="faq" -->
<a href="#about">About</a>  <!-- Jumps to id="about" -->
```

These work because each section has a matching `id`:
```html
<section id="features">...</section>
<section id="benefits">...</section>
```

**Don't change these** unless you rename the section IDs.

---

### Fixing the "Watch Demo" Button

**Current code (Line 127-129):**
```html
<button class="btn-secondary bg-gray-800 border-2 border-purple-500 px-8 py-4 rounded-lg font-bold text-lg hover:bg-gray-700 transition-all duration-300 inline-flex items-center justify-center">
    <i class="fas fa-play-circle mr-2"></i>
    Watch Demo
</button>
```

This is a `<button>` not a link. To make it functional, change it to a link:

```html
<a href="https://yourcompany.com/demo" class="btn-secondary bg-gray-800 border-2 border-purple-500 px-8 py-4 rounded-lg font-bold text-lg hover:bg-gray-700 transition-all duration-300 inline-flex items-center justify-center">
    <i class="fas fa-play-circle mr-2"></i>
    Watch Demo
</a>
```

## Adding Privacy and Terms Pages

### Understanding the Structure

Your landing page needs to link to three new pages:
1. `privacy.html` - Privacy Policy
2. `terms.html` - Terms of Service

These links are already in the footer, but the pages don't exist yet.

---

### Step 1: Create the Privacy Policy Page

**Create a new file:**
1. In your text editor, create a new file
2. Save it as `privacy.html` in the same folder as `index.html`
3. Copy this template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta name="description" content="Privacy Policy - AI Automation Partner">
    <title>Privacy Policy - AI Automation Partner</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css">
    <style>
        html {
            scroll-behavior: smooth;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body class="bg-gray-900 text-white">
    <!-- Header & Navigation -->
    <header class="sticky top-0 z-50 bg-gray-900 bg-opacity-95 backdrop-blur-md border-b border-gray-800">

            <div class="flex items-center space-x-2">
                <div class="w-10 h-10 bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-pink-600 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center">

```

### Step 3: Verify Links in Footer

The footer already has the correct links set up. Check lines 623-625 in your `index.html`:

```html
<li><a href="privacy.html" class="text-gray-400 hover:text-white transition-colors duration-300">Privacy Policy</a></li>
<li><a href="terms.html" class="text-gray-400 hover:text-white transition-colors duration-300">Terms of Service</a></li>
```

These links are already correct and will work as long as:
1. `privacy.html` and `terms.html` are in the same folder as `index.html`
2. You've created both files with the templates above

---

### Step 4: Test the Links

1. Save all three files (`index.html`, `privacy.html`, `terms.html`) in the same folder
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Scroll to the footer
4. Click "Privacy Policy" - it should open `privacy.html`
5. Click "Terms of Service" - it should open `terms.html`
6. Click "Back to Home" on those pages - it should return to `index.html`

---

### Customizing the Privacy and Terms Pages

**Update company information:**

In both `privacy.html` and `terms.html`, find and replace:
- `AI Automation Partner` - your company name
- `privacy@test.com` - your actual email
- `January 2025` - current date

**Make the content your own:**

The templates provided are generic. You should:
1. Customize the content to match your actual practices
2. Add specific details about your data collection
3. Include your company's actual policies
4. Consider having a lawyer review these documents

## Responsive Design Considerations

### What is Responsive Design?

Responsive design means your page looks good on:
- Desktop computers (large screens)
- Tablets (medium screens)
- Mobile phones (small screens)

This page is already responsive, but here's how to maintain that when making changes.

---

### Understanding Responsive Classes

Tailwind CSS uses prefixes for different screen sizes:

| Prefix | Screen Size | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| (none) | Mobile first (all sizes) | `text-4xl` |
| `sm:` | Small screens (640px+) | `sm:text-5xl` |
| `md:` | Medium screens (768px+) | `md:flex` |
| `lg:` | Large screens (1024px+) | `lg:text-7xl` |

**Example from the page:**
```html
<h1 class="text-4xl sm:text-5xl lg:text-7xl font-bold">
```

This means:
- On mobile: use `text-4xl` (smaller)
- On small screens and up: use `sm:text-5xl` (medium)
- On large screens and up: use `lg:text-7xl` (largest)

### When Adding New Content

Always include responsive variants:

❌ **Bad (not responsive):**
```html
<h2 class="text-5xl font-bold">My Heading</h2>
```

✅ **Good (responsive):**
```html
<h2 class="text-3xl sm:text-4xl lg:text-5xl font-bold">My Heading</h2>
```

### Grid Layouts

The page uses responsive grids:

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
```

This means:
- On mobile: 1 column
- On medium screens: 2 columns
- On large screens: 3 columns

When modifying grids, keep this pattern.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Links Don't Work

**Problem:** Clicking a link does nothing

**Solutions:**
1. Check the `href` attribute - is it correct?
2. Make sure it's spelled exactly right (including capitalization)
3. For internal links (with `#`), make sure the section has a matching `id`

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Link -->
<a href="#features">Features</a>

<!-- Corresponding section (must match) -->
<section id="features">...</section>
```

---

#### Issue 2: Mobile Menu Doesn't Work

**Problem:** The hamburger menu on mobile doesn't open

**Solution:**
1. Check that JavaScript is enabled in your browser
2. Make sure you haven't deleted the JavaScript code at the bottom
3. Look for errors in the browser console (F12 → Console tab)

---

#### Issue 3: Colors Look Wrong

**Problem:** Changed a color but it doesn't show

**Solutions:**
1. Did you save the file? (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
2. Refresh your browser (F5 or Cmd+R)
3. Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) to clear cache
4. Check that you changed the right class
5. Make sure you didn't accidentally delete quotes around the color value

---

#### Issue 4: Layout is Broken

**Problem:** Elements are overlapping or in wrong positions

**Solutions:**
1. Check that you didn't accidentally delete any closing tags (`</div>`, `</section>`)
2. Make sure indentation is consistent (helps spot missing tags)
3. Look for mismatched quotes or brackets
4. Use your browser's Inspect tool (F12) to see the HTML structure

---

#### Issue 5: Icons Don't Show

**Problem:** You see empty boxes instead of icons

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure the Font Awesome CDN link is still in the `<head>` (line 11)
2. Check the icon name is correct: `fa-cogs`, `fa-rocket`, etc.
3. Visit [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/icons) to find correct icon names
4. Icon names should be lowercase with hyphens

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Correct -->
<i class="fas fa-rocket"></i>

<!-- Incorrect -->
<i class="fas fa-Rocket"></i>
```

---

#### Issue 6: Text Overflows or Is Cut Off

**Problem:** Text extends beyond the container

**Solutions:**
1. Check the container width: `max-w-7xl`, `max-w-4xl`, etc.
2. Add more padding if needed: `px-4`, `px-6`, `px-8`
3. Reduce text size: use smaller Tailwind text classes
4. On mobile, text should be smaller (use responsive classes)

---

#### Issue 7: FAQ Accordion Doesn't Work

**Problem:** Clicking FAQ questions doesn't expand answers

**Solutions:**
1. Check that JavaScript is enabled
2. Make sure the JavaScript code at the bottom is intact
3. Check that the HTML structure matches:
   - `<div class="faq-item">` (outer container)
   - `<button class="faq-question">` (clickable part)
   - `<div class="faq-answer hidden">` (hidden answer)

---

#### Issue 8: Changes Don't Appear

**Problem:** You made changes but don't see them

**Solutions:**
1. Save the file (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
2. Refresh the browser (F5 or Cmd+R)
3. Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows, Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
4. Close and reopen the file
5. Check you're editing the right file

---

### Using Browser Developer Tools

**To access:**
1. Right-click on the page
2. Select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"
3. This opens the Developer Tools

**What you can do:**
- See the HTML structure
- Check applied CSS classes
- Find errors in the console
- Test responsive layouts (click device icons)

**Finding errors:**
1. Press F12
2. Click the "Console" tab
3. Look for red error messages
4. These often tell you exactly what's wrong

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Make Backups

Before making major changes:
1. Copy the entire `index.html` file
2. Rename it to `index-backup.html`
3. Keep it in the same folder
4. If something breaks, you can restore from backup

### 2. Make Changes One Section at a Time

Don't change everything at once. Instead:
1. Make one change
2. Save and test
3. Make the next change
4. This makes it easier to find problems

### 3. Keep Your Code Organized

- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)
- Keep related content together
- Use comments to mark sections

Example:
```html
<!-- HERO SECTION -->
<section id="hero">
    <!-- Your content -->
</section>

<!-- FEATURES SECTION -->
<section id="features">
    <!-- Your content -->
</section>
```

### 4. Test on Mobile

Always check how your changes look on mobile:
1. Open the page in your browser
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Click the device icon (top left of DevTools)
4. Select different devices to test

### 5. Use Meaningful Link Text

❌ Bad:
```html
<a href="https://example.com">Click here</a>
```

✅ Good:
```html
<a href="https://example.com">Learn more about our pricing</a>
```
